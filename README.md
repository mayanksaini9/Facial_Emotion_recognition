# 🎭 Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN & RNN

![Facial Emotion Recognition](https://your-image-link.com)

## 🚀 Overview
This project implements a **Facial Emotion Recognition** system using the **FER2013 dataset**. We leverage the power of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for feature extraction and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** for sequential learning to enhance emotion classification accuracy. 

---

## 📂 Dataset - FER2013
FER2013 is a publicly available dataset consisting of **grayscale images (48x48 pixels)** categorized into **seven emotions**:
🎭 **Angry** | 😖 **Disgust** | 😨 **Fear** | 😃 **Happy** | 😐 **Neutral** | 😢 **Sad** | 😲 **Surprise**

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
### 🔹 Hybrid Approach
✅ **CNN** - Extracts spatial features from facial images.
✅ **RNN (LSTM/GRU)** - Processes extracted features sequentially.
✅ **Softmax Activation** - Classifies emotions into one of the seven categories.

### 🔹 Steps in Model Development
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing** 🛠️
   - Image normalization and resizing.
   - Data augmentation for better generalization.
   
2️⃣ **Model Training** 📈
   - Feature extraction using CNN.
   - Sequential learning using RNN.
   - Multi-class classification with Softmax.

3️⃣ **Evaluation & Performance Metrics** 📊
   - **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score**.
   - **Confusion Matrix** for error analysis.
